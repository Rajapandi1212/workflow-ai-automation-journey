**Task 5: Setup Basic Automation Scripts**

---

### Practical Problem: Create a Simple Automation Script

---

**Scenario:**
You need to automate a small but common task: **daily fetching of a public APIâ€™s data and saving it locally**.

---

### Your Task:

1. Write a script (choose **Shell**, **Node.js**, or **Python**) that does the following:

   - Fetches data from this sample API: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`
   - Saves the fetched JSON response into a file named `data.json` in your project folder.

2. Make sure your script:

   - Handles errors gracefully (e.g., network failure).
   - Prints a success or failure message after the fetch.

3. Optional: Add a timestamp in the saved file or console output.

---

### Deliverable:

- A script file (`.sh`, `.js`, or `.py`) that performs the above.
- A brief explanation of how your script works.
